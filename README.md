### About Me

My name is Rory Ulmer (he/him) and I'm from Vermont. I am currently a student at University of Vermont pursuing a B.S. in Mathematical Sciences (Fall '24) and M.S. in Computer Science (Fall '25) through the Accelerated Master's Program. What I enjoy most about programming is the creativity involved-- there are often many different solutions to the same problem, and it is up to us to find the one best suited to our needs. I have a strong interest in math and love how they complement each other in problem solving. As hobbies, I enjoy designing board games, writing songs on guitar, and playing table tennis.
