### About Me
Hi, I'm Rory! I grew up in Richmond, VT then moved to Waitsfield, and am currently pursuing a B.S. in Mathematical Sciences at UVM (graduating fall '24). I will be doing my M.S. in Computer Science at UVM through the Accelerated Master's Program. I'm a fast-learner who brings lots of enthusiasm towards the work I do and I love being creative and solving problems. As hobbies, I enjoy designing [board games](https://github.com/rouloct/Board-Game), writing songs on guitar, and playing table tennis for the team at UVM.
